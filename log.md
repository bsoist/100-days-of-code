### Day 20: April 9, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

I did not complete all of the problems durimg the competition so I solved them today.
### Day 19: April 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

I competed in Google Code Jam. I made a strategic mistake and did not qualify. I should know better by now. 

### Day 18: April 6, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

I solved two problems from Google Code Jam rounds in which I did not compete.

### Day 17: April 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

I solved three more problems from Google Code Jam rounds in which I did not compete.

**Thoughts:** 

I didn't particularly like some of the early round 2021 problems so I started at 2020. There were a few really fun problems in the qualificaiton round and 1A.
### Day 16: April 4, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

I solved three more problems from Google Code Jam rounds in which I did not compete.

**Thoughts:** 

I realized I didn't have any record of competing (or solving any of the problems) for 2010 or 20111 so I decided to go back and solve those. And then... I decided to work on more recent problems and solve problems from some of the later rounds.

### Day 15: April 2, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

I spent a couple of hours solving the two problems for Google Code Jam which I did not finish yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** 
Really fun problems this year. Two of them stumped me a little bit, but they were lots of fun


### Day 14: April 1, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

I spent a couple of hours solving three of the five problems for Google Code Jam. I earned enought points to compete next round, so I went to bed. :) 

### Day 13: March 31, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

I solved one more problem on code arcade and then I wrote some setup code for Google Code Jam tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** 

Google Code Jam snuck up on me this year, but I'm looking forward to it.

I'm a lttle tired of these problems that can be solved in just one line. They feel more like math to me. I love math, and I like that part of it, but I have been writing other ways to calculate the totals.

### Day 12: March 30, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

I solved one more of the code signal problems in C, Python, and JavaScript. I also spent some time addressing a bug in the program I wrote to check student work.

### Day 11: March 29, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

Finished The Core problems 27 and 28. 

**Thoughts:** 
These were fairly simple simulations. I did review a couple other solutions and noticed that I could have done even better on Lineup by just noting that they'd be different if the command was `L` or `R`.

### Day 10: March 28, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

Worked on several more problems.

**Thoughts:** 

Finally back to some that aren't one-liners.

### Day 9: March 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

I worked on another problem. Couldn't finish it.


### Day 8: March 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

I decided to move on to later problems since I am tired of re-doing the old ones for now. I miss seeing new ones. 

**Thoughts:** 

The two I did were not as much fun. I don't like the requirement to do one-liners, though, sometimes I do them on my own - I like it to be my idea. :)

* [The Core 20, Mirror Bits](https://github.com/bsoist/codesignal-arcade-solutions/blob/main/1_the_core/020_mirrorBIts.md)

### Day 7: March 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:**

Completed JavaScript and C solutoins for Intro problems 14, and 15. I never completed 13.

**Link to work:**

* [Intro 14, Alternating Sums](https://github.com/bsoist/codesignal-arcade-solutions/blob/main/0_intro/014_alternatingSums.md)
* [Intro 15, Add Border](https://github.com/bsoist/codesignal-arcade-solutions/blob/main/0_intro/015_addBorder.md)
### Day 6: March 23, 2022
**Today's Progress:**

I completed C and JavaScript solutions for two more of the solutions. 

**Thoughts:** 

I spent far too much time down a rabbit hole with an idea for the C solution to number 11. **Way too much time** on that. :) 

Re-writing my Python solutions in other languages has been far more educational than I expected it to be. I typically do work in one of the three languages based on context, but purposely writing solutions to the same problems in all three has me thinking through the differences much more carefully. Mostly stuff I "knew already" but it forces me to acknowledge the differences at every step. 

I'm probably not doing a great job explaining it, but I think there is some longer writing to do on this subject.

### Day 5: March 22, 2022
**Today's Progress:**

I completed intro problem nine in JavaScript and C. I was stuck on the C version for a bit because of the CodeSignal-specific arrays.

### Day 4: March 21, 2022
**Today's Progress:**

I spent a lot of time fidgeting with my - already working :) - Python solutoin for intro 7. In the end, I left it alone. Then I tried to implement a JavaScript version, but got hung up on the checking for duplicates without exceeding the time limit.

### Day 2: March 19, 2022
**Today's Progress:**

Today I finished up a couple more CodeSignal Arcade problems and I setup [this repo](https://github.com/bsoist/codesignal-arcade-solutions) to share them.

### Day 1: March 18, 2022
**Today's Progress:**

1. I forked [F1-Web-Viewer](https://github.com/bootsie123/F1-Web-Viewer) and played around with it. I need to experiment with it tomorrow during a live event. If I can't get it to work then, it would make an interesting project to try and make it work.
1. Then I experimented with [Fast-F1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1) a bit. I installed it via pip and ran the example. 
1. Then I played around with pulling some data from today's practice. 
1. I also took another practice test for the test I have scheduled next week.

**Thoughts:** 
* I'm very excited about this kind of access to F1 data. Very cool!

### Day 0: March 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I had a programming test to take. 

**Thoughts:** I did pretty well on three of the four tasks. I didn't finish the other one in the time limit, but I want to work on it tomorrow.

**Link to work:** I'm not permitted to share code for this one.
