# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: March 23, 2022
**Today's Progress:**

I completed C and JavaScript solutions for two more of the solutions. 

**Thoughts:** 

I spent far too much time down a rabbit hole with an idea for the C solution to number 11. **Way too much time** on that. :) 

Re-writing my Python solutions in other languages has been far more educational than I expected it to be. I typically do work in one of the three languages based on context, but purposely writing solutions to the same problems in all three has me thinking through the differences much more carefully. Mostly stuff I "knew already" but it forces me to acknowledge the differences at every step. 

I'm probably not doing a great job explaining it, but I think there is some longer writing to do on this subject.

### Day 5: March 22, 2022
**Today's Progress:**

I completed intro problem nine in JavaScript and C. I was stuck on the C version for a bit because of the CodeSignal-specific arrays.

### Day 4: March 21, 2022
**Today's Progress:**

I spent a lot of time fidgeting with my - already working :) - Python solutoin for intro 7. In the end, I left it alone. Then I tried to implement a JavaScript version, but got hung up on the checking for duplicates without exceeding the time limit.

### Day 2: March 19, 2022
**Today's Progress:**

Today I finished up a couple more CodeSignal Arcade problems and I setup [this repo](https://github.com/bsoist/codesignal-arcade-solutions) to share them.

### Day 1: March 18, 2022
**Today's Progress:**

1. I forked [F1-Web-Viewer](https://github.com/bootsie123/F1-Web-Viewer) and played around with it. I need to experiment with it tomorrow during a live event. If I can't get it to work then, it would make an interesting project to try and make it work.
1. Then I experimented with [Fast-F1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1) a bit. I installed it via pip and ran the example. 
1. Then I played around with pulling some data from today's practice. 
1. I also took another practice test for the test I have scheduled next week.

**Thoughts:** 
* I'm very excited about this kind of access to F1 data. Very cool!

### Day 0: March 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I had a programming test to take. 

**Thoughts:** I did pretty well on three of the four tasks. I didn't finish the other one in the time limit, but I want to work on it tomorrow.

**Link to work:** I'm not permitted to share code for this one.
