# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 5: March 22, 2022
**Today's Progress:**
I completed intro problem nine in JavaScript and C. I was stuck on the C version for a bit because of the CodeSignal-specific arrays.

[Intro, problem 10](https://github.com/bsoist/codesignal-arcade-solutions/blob/main/0_intro/010_commonCharacterCount.md)

### Day 4: March 21, 2022
**Today's Progress:**
I spent a lot of time fidgeting with my - already working :) - Python solutoin for intro 7. In the end, I left it alone. Then I tried to implement a JavaScript version, but got hung up on the checking for duplicates without exceeding the time limit.

### Day 2: March 19, 2022

Today I finished up a couple more CodeSignal Arcade problems and I setup [this repo](https://github.com/bsoist/codesignal-arcade-solutions) to share them.

### Day 1: March 18, 2022
**Today's Progress:**
1. I forked [F1-Web-Viewer](https://github.com/bootsie123/F1-Web-Viewer) and played around with it. I need to experiment with it tomorrow during a live event. If I can't get it to work then, it would make an interesting project to try and make it work.
1. Then I experimented with [Fast-F1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1) a bit. I installed it via pip and ran the example. 
1. Then I played around with pulling some data from today's practice. 
1. I also took another practice test for the test I have scheduled next week.

**Thoughts:** 
* I'm very excited about this kind of access to F1 data. Very cool!

### Day 0: March 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I had a programming test to take. 

**Thoughts:** I did pretty well on three of the four tasks. I didn't finish the other one in the time limit, but I want to work on it tomorrow.

**Link to work:** I'm not permitted to share code for this one.
