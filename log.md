# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I had a programming test to take. 

**Thoughts:** I did pretty well on three of the four tasks. I didn't finish the other one in the time limit, but I want to work on it tomorrow.

**Link to work:** I'm not permitted to share code for this one.
